My repo/project matrix is a tool for people working (especially) with matrices and linear algebra.
It is a LEARNING/TEACHING tool but, by not means, I intent to substitute linear algebra introdutory courses,
nor I plan to provide a "cheating tool". Instead I'm trying to develop a tool that can be used along the
knowledged acquered from linear algebra courses.

    Row
        A sequence of numerical values read from left to right.

        A row is initialized as followed Row([...]). Row forcefully has to be initialized with an instance of
            a sequence of ordered numerical values such as list, tuple. and the values in such data structure
            has to be numerical values.
