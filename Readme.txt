My repo/project matrix is a tool for people working (especially) with matrices and linear algebra.
It is a LEARNING/TEACHING tool but, by not means, I intent to substitute linear algebra introdutory courses,
nor I plan to provide a "cheating tool". Instead I'm trying to develop a tool that can be used along the
knowledged acquered from linear algebra courses.
